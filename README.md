# Bioreactor Simulation for Cultivated Meat Production

This repository contains the driver code for the **two-phase flow simulation of a rocking bioreactor**, implemented in the [Basilisk](http://basilisk.fr/) open-source CFD platform. This collaborative work is conducted at the intersection between the Scientific Computing Group at the University of Warwick led by [Dr. Radu Cimpeanu](https://www.raducimpeanu.com/) and the Harris Lab at Brown University led by [Prof. Daniel Harris](https://vivo.brown.edu/display/dharri15), with [Dr. Minki Kim](https://www.minki-kim.com/) (Brown University) as lead developer. The open-access publication is available at [doi: 10.1016/j.ijmultiphaseflow.2025.105375](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301932225002538#d1e10550), while the associated preprint for this work is available on [arXiv: 2504.05421](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05421).

## üìå Features:
‚úÖ Liquid-gas dynamics with embedded solid boundaries inside a two-dimensional rocking bioreactor  
‚úÖ Tracer advection/diffusion for evaluating mixing efficiency  
‚úÖ Oxygen transport, including advection, diffusion and gas-to-liquid interfacial transfer  
‚úÖ Body acceleration in a non-inertial frame of reference, accounting for gravity, Coriolis, and centrifugal effects

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### 1. Requirements
- [Basilisk](http://basilisk.fr/) (compiled with `qcc`)
- C compiler
- Gnuplot / ffmpeg (for visualizing results)
```bash
sudo apt install gnuplot imagemagick ffmpeg graphviz valgrind gifsicle pstoedit
```

### 2. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rcsc-group/BioReactor
cd DriverCodes
```
### 3. Installing Basilisk
The code relies on Basilisk to solve the Navier‚ÄìStokes equations. Please refer to the [Basilisk installation page](http://basilisk.fr/src/INSTALL) for detailed setup instructions.

### 4. Copy and paste the header files and compile the main code
- Copy the four header files (draw3.h, henry_oxy2.h, utils2.h, and view3.h) into the src folder of the Basilisk source directory.
- Run the shell script using: sh BioReactor.sh
- The shell script runs the executable file: ./Bioreactor L_bio ANGLE RPM
  - L_bio: Reference length scale in meters (e.g., 0.25)
  - ANGLE: Rocking angle in degrees (e.g., 7)
  - RPM: Rocking frequency in RPM (e.g., 32.5)

## üìÅ Folder Structure

```bash
.                        
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.c                 # Main bioreactor simulation code
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ henry_oxy2.h           # Header for oxygen transport functionality
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ view3.h, utils2.h      # Visualization and utility functions (customized)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Data_all/              # Simulation output (velocity, tracer, oxygen, etc.)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Fig_vol/, Fig_tr/, ... # Saved PNG images for different fields
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ logstats.dat           # Performance and runtime log
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ normf.dat              # Velocity/vorticity/volume fraction norms over time
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ vol_frac_interf.dat    # Interface volume fraction statistics
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tr_oxy.dat             # Integrated tracer and oxygen values
```

## üìä Outputs

Generates:
- `Data_all/*.txt`: all field variables and interface geometries for the chosen simulation times
- `.dat` files of statistics (e.g., vorticity, velocity, volume fraction, etc.) and performance logs
- `*.mp4` videos (vorticity, tracer, oxygen, volume fraction)
- `*.png` figures (vorticity, tracer, oxygen, volume fraction)

Video generation is quite resource-intensive, and may be switched on and off depending on the stage of the development cycle. Beyond production runs purposes, we occasionally found these useful for debugging as well, however the frame rate can be adapted accordingly via the dt_video variable specification.
